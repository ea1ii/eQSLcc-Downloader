This program allows to download eQSL pictures from eQSL.cc to your local drive.

Only the unloaded pics will be downloaded on each session.

Multiple callsigns are possible.

Usage is quiet straightforward but I could work some more instructions if requiere. Feel free to reach me with any question or any suggestion.

To download follow the Releases link on the right side.

If you like my work, please consider buying me a coffee
