SYNOPSIS
========
Responding to increasing demand for a mechanism by which loggers can retrieve the graphical
image of an eQSL "card" on request from its recipient, we have created this GeteQSL.cfm program.

The old technique that some programmers had discovered (using the DisplayQSL.cfm program)
was not secure and not designed to be called from outside the system. We had to do something.

The new GeteQSL.cfm program can be accessed by doing a simple HTTP POST or GET from any
program written in a modern development language that can use HTTP. When the required parameters
have been specified correctly, the program returns a page containing the URL where the graphical
eQSL "card" can be retrieved.

You can retrieve eQSLs sent to a user whose Callsign and Password are known, when that eQSL is either
in the InBox or in the Archive, but none which have already been rejected by the recipient.

CAUTION
=======
Graphics for eQSLs are generated on-the-fly, i.e. at the time they are requested. This is a
processor-intensive task that has the potential to slow down the entire system.  Please limit your
use of the GeteQSL.cfm program to individual eQSLs at a speed of less than 6 per minute.

Do not use huge number of simultaneous threads, as this will eventually max out our web server and
shut other users out of the system.  Do not mass-download entire Inboxes full of eQSL graphics.

Please also implement a mechanism for determining whether you have already downloaded any given eQSL,
and refrain from downloading the same eQSL over and over.

We are providing GeteQSL.cfm as a courtesy to logger publishers, but if it starts interfering with
our system speed, we will be forced to implement throttles to protect our users. We log every use
of the GeteQSL.cfm program and the webmaster has real-time monitors tracking its use versus processor
utilization.

HOW TO USE THE "GeteQSL.cfm" PROGRAM
====================================
The URL is http://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/GeteQSL.cfm (case insensitive)

The following parameters are required:
  Username        The callsign of the recipient of the eQSL
  Password        The password of the user's account
  CallsignFrom    The callsign of the sender of the eQSL
  QSOYear         YYYY OR YY format date of the QSO
  QSOMonth        MM format
  QSODay          DD format
  QSOHour         HH format (24-hour time)
  QSOMinute       MM format
  QSOBand         20m, 80M, 70cm, etc. (case insensitive)
  QSOMode         Must match exactly and should be an ADIF-compatible mode

Parameters may be included in the URL as shown below in the TEST PROCEDURE, or may be
included internally in the HTTP command in a set of form parameters.  (If slashes are used
in a callsign or a date in the URL method of submission, they MUST be escaped properly.)

Date/Time must match the desired eQSL to within plus or minus 5 minutes of the time stored in the eQSL.
Mode must match exactly, unless you specify a submode of JT65 (for instance JT65A) or JT9 (for instance JT9-1), in which case the major mode will be used to search for a match (JT65 or JT9 respectively).

RETURN PAGE FORMAT:
===================
The returned page will contain various amounts of text, due to the fact that we are using
internal subroutines that often generate HTML comments.

The easiest way to parse the returned page is
1. Search for the string "Error:" and if found, display the entire page to determine
the source of the error and correct it before continuing

2. If no error was found, search for the string "<IMG SRC=" and then use the following text
string that will be comma-delimited as the relative URL pointing to the location of the eQSL
graphic in a temporary file folder.  Download that file within the next few hours as it will
be automatically purged periodically.
 
Here is a list of all the error messages:

     Error: You must specify the QSO Date/Time as QSOYear, QSOMonth, QSODay, QSOHour, and QSOMinute
     Error: No match on Username/Password for that QSO Date/Time
     Error: (n) overlapping accounts for that QSO Date/Time. User needs to correct that immediately
     Error: I cannot find that log entry
     Error: That QSO has been Rejected by (username)


TEST PROCEDURE
==============
You can test the proper operation of your calling program and retrieval of an eQSL by looking
at an eQSL in your Archive and then specifying the parameters something like this:

http://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/GeteQSL.cfm?Username=mycall&Password=mypassword&CallsignFrom=sendercall&QSOBand=20M&QSOMode=SSB&QSOYear=2009&QSOMonth=6&QSODay=1&QSOHour=07&QSOMinute=30


MODIFICATION HISTORY
====================
03Dec2012 Formerly, the time had to match to within the same minute, or it would take the hour and look for a match from minute 00 to minute 59. This has been changed to allow wrapping around not only hours, but also days, plus or minute 5 minutes of tolerance. Also, match on JT65 or JT9 and not on the submode of those.
